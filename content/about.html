<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Davis Vaughan, a Master’s student studying Mathematical Finance at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I enjoy all things R. I’m also a coffee enthusiast, as most R users seem to be.</p>

<div id="what-else" class="section level3">
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>I’m the other half of <a href="http://www.business-science.io/">Business Science</a>. We develop R packages for financial analysis. Additionally, we have a network of data scientists at our disposal to bring together the best team to work on consulting projects. Check out our website to learn more!</p>
<p>I helped co-author two R packages with <a href="https://github.com/mdancho84">Matt Dancho</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/">tidyquant</a> - Bringing financial analysis to the tidyverse</li>
<li><a href="https://business-science.github.io/timetk/">timetk</a> - A collection of tools for working with time series</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also interested in Data Science and Quantitative Finance. I’ll be looking for job opportunities post graduation in May 2018.</p>
