<p>A number of resources I found useful while learning about copulas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/bloomfield/courses/st810j/slides/copula.pdf">NC State University lecture notes</a> - A consise introduction into copulas. This is a good place to start but not a good place to find examples.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thierry-roncalli.com/download/copula-survey.pdf">Copulas for Finance: A Reading Guide and Some Applications</a> - A much more intense survey of copulas. Math heavy but full of examples. Page 20 includes a few simulation techniques, but overcomplicates the simple ones (Gaussian copula) in order to stay general.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)">Wiki: Copulas</a> - The mathematical definition section, along with Sklar’s theorem and the section of Gaussian Copulas makes this worthwhile to look at.</p>
<p><a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114786/in-definition-of-gaussian-copula-does-the-marginals-also-have-to-be-gaussian">StackExchange answer</a> - This was the missing link for me. A great description of the “point of a copula.” The full explanation in the last paragraph of the answer made things click for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://datascienceplus.com/modelling-dependence-with-copulas/">DataScience+</a> - A good walkthrough of using the <code>copula</code> R package. Includes an example of using a t-copula with normal marginals.</p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/copula/">copula</a> - The copula R package. A one stop shop for your copula needs if you use R and don’t want to (or have to) implement it all yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples/simulating-dependent-random-variables-using-copulas.html#d119e194">Matlab example</a> - Obviously the code is all in matlab, but they do a nice job of explaining how to simulate from copulas, without the theory.</p>
