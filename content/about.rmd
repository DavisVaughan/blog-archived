### Who am I?

I'm Davis, a Software Engineer at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) working on [modeling in the tidyverse](https://github.com/tidymodels). I enjoy all things R. I'm also a coffee enthusiast, as most R users seem to be.

### What else?

I've developed a few R packages:

- [furrr](https://davisvaughan.github.io/furrr/)
- [probably](https://tidymodels.github.io/probably/)
- [rray](https://davisvaughan.github.io/rray/)

I also helped co-author a few R packages with [Matt Dancho](https://github.com/mdancho84):

- [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/)
- [timetk](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/)
- [tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/)
