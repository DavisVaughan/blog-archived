### Who am I?

Hi! I'm Davis Vaughan, a Master's student studying Mathematical Finance at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I enjoy all things R. I'm also a coffee enthusiast, as most R users seem to be.

### What else?

I'm the other half of [Business Science](http://www.business-science.io/). We develop R packages for financial analysis. Additionally, we have a network of data scientists at our disposal to bring together the best team to work on consulting projects. Check out our website to learn more!

I helped co-author two R packages with [Matt Dancho](https://github.com/mdancho84):

- [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) - Bringing financial analysis to the tidyverse
- [timetk](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/) - A collection of tools for working with time series 

I'm also interested in Data Science and Quantitative Finance. I'll be looking for job opportunities post graduation in May 2018.

### Want to get in touch?

I'm always up for a conversation about R or Finance. Tweet at me [here](https://twitter.com/dvaughan32) or send me an email at _dvaughan@business-science.io_
